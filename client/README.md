# 🔐 BlockVault  
**Decentralized Image Uploading and Sharing using Blockchain & IPFS**

BlockVault is a decentralized application (dApp) that enables users to securely upload images to IPFS and control access using Ethereum smart contracts. It’s like a decentralized Google Drive where *you* control who gets access to your data.

## ✨ Features

- **Decentralized Storage**  
  Images are uploaded to IPFS, ensuring tamper-proof and distributed storage.

- **Smart Contract Access Control**  
  Uses Solidity smart contracts deployed on Ethereum to manage permissions and ownership.

- **User-Defined Sharing**  
  Grant or revoke access to your uploaded images to specific Ethereum wallet addresses.
